It can be harder to cook rice in a pot because you have to understand the rice to water ratio and know when to change the temperature during cooking. However, it can be done with the right steps and a lot of practice. Once you have gotten used to the type of rice, the water needed, and your cookware, it will be quite easy!Cooking rice in a pot is different from cooking rice in a traditional rice cooker (or rice steamer).",
